## Motivation

As a developer, (unless you are very fortunate) we work with many different languages, frameworks and tools.
Even if one is working on same framework with same language, you are bound to work with different versions of 
the language or a framework (or both) depending on a project you are assigned to. This creates interesting 
challenges on identifying and configuring a right tool for a right job.

There are many tools that could solve the problem, but I eventually settled on `nix`, `flake`, `home-manager`.
and dotfiles as git repository.

I am going to go over alternative tools, and explain why I settled with nix.

## Other tools

### homebrew or os specific package manager.

In OSX, package managers like homebrew, apt, apk, yum, and others that 
come with operating systems are really convenient when setting up one 
version of software that applies to the entire system. However, I
develop and manage programs that are distributed across hundreds of git repositories. 
These programs are not created overnight but accumulate over time in each repository.

Therefore, older programs that I made may not work with different
versions of languages and build tools. Especially now that new versions
of languages like Java or NodeJS are released every six months,
version diversity is increasing.

Also, because the programming languages and their versions used are different,
even though each repository has instructions for installing and setting up
development tools in their README.md files, it is common for them to 
not work properly when I try to run them again after a few years.


### pyenv, nvm, jenv

I started using a program version management tool because I couldn't keep up with all the package management programs. Initially, I started with environment configuration tools for specific languages, such as pyenv for Python, nvm for Node.js, and jenv for Java. However, as I manage too many repositories, these configuration tools also became harder to use over time as they are updated, and their usage and provided language versions change.

Furthermore, each program has different installation methods and bash configuration methods, so teaching all my colleagues the installation process was very time-consuming.

While searching for a tool to solve all these problems with one program, I came across asdf-vm.

### What about Docker? 

When developing a software, I highly value fast feedback between my code and the result I produce.
For that, I rely on my IDE or editor's fast response on various things (syntax highlighting, syntax error, type error, debugger, ...)

Hosting my code in docker and piping into my local development setup always has been sub-optimal, thus
docker was never my consideration.

<div class="nes-container with-title">
<p class="title">Problems</p>
* Difficult to maintain documentations for all tools
  * Install instruction for each tool
  * Environment set up instructions (bash, zsh, fish... etc)
  * Only limited
* Difficult to maintain plugin versions synced for all developers
  * Creating work-my-machine-but-not-yours situation
</div>

## So Nix can solve all of the problems?

Well, not 100%, but very close to it. I am happy with it at the moment

### What is Nix?

Nix is a package manager and a language used to manage software dependencies and builds.
It's different from other package managers because it uses a purely functional approach,
which means that packages are isolated and have their own dependencies. This makes it 
easy to create consistent and reproducible software environments. 

Nix also has a powerful language for describing software builds, which allows developers 
to specify exact versions and configurations of dependencies. Nix is commonly used in 
research and scientific computing to ensure that experiments are reproducible, and 
in production environments to maintain consistent and reliable software versions. 

Overall, Nix is a useful tool for managing software dependencies and builds with 
a focus on reproducibility and maintainability.

### So why use flake?

Nix Flake is a recent addition to the Nix package manager that aims to simplify and 
streamline the management of Nix packages and configurations. It allows developers 
to define all their dependencies, configurations, and build processes in a single file 
called a "flake," which can be easily version-controlled and shared across different 
projects.

Nix's flake always comes with set of two files at minimum. `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` file.
`flake.nix`'s content includes declaration of inputs and outputs. 

```nix
{
  description = "Home Manager for Nix";

  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  inputs.utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, utils, ... }:
}
```

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "nixpkgs": {
      "locked": {
        "lastModified": 1677932085,
        "narHash": "sha256-+AB4dYllWig8iO6vAiGGYl0NEgmMgGHpy9gzWJ3322g=",
        "owner": "nixos",
        "repo": "nixpkgs",
        "rev": "3c5319ad3aa51551182ac82ea17ab1c6b0f0df89",
        "type": "github"
      },
      "original": {
        "owner": "nixos",
        "ref": "nixos-unstable",
        "repo": "nixpkgs",
        "type": "github"
      }
    },
    "root": {
      "inputs": {
        "nixpkgs": "nixpkgs",
        "utils": "utils"
      }
    },
    "utils": {
      "locked": {
        "lastModified": 1676283394,
        "narHash": "sha256-XX2f9c3iySLCw54rJ/CZs+ZK6IQy7GXNY4nSOyu2QG4=",
        "owner": "numtide",
        "repo": "flake-utils",
        "rev": "3db36a8b464d0c4532ba1c7dda728f4576d6d073",
        "type": "github"
      },
      "original": {
        "owner": "numtide",
        "repo": "flake-utils",
        "type": "github"
      }
    }
  },
  "root": "root",
  "version": 7
}
```

Above two files are from https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager

Just like `package-lock.json`, flake commits snapshot of inputs. This can eliminate most of our 
work-on-my-machine problem.

## So now what?

On the next post, I will go over the basic set up, then expand the set up over to be shared with others.
