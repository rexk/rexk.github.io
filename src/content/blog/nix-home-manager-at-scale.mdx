## Goal

We are going to create further hierarchy on both home-manager configurations
and shell configurations so that we can separate common configuration out of user
specific configurations. This allows us to maintain set of common setup, without
compromising user customization.

We are going to start making these changes from https://github.com/rexk/dotfiles/tree/nix-flake-install-stage-04

For those who are impatient, you can find the final result at https://github.com/rexk/dotfiles/tree/nix-flake-install-stage-05


## home manager configurations

In order to provide user specific configurations, we would like to make following changes.

1. Update home.nix to import user specific configurations, if exists
2. Provide common template for invidual users to get started with user specific configurations
3. Provide set of common packages.
4. Provide means to override those common packages via user specific configurations.


```diff
+# This is common homemanager configuration file
+# with common setup.
+#
+# DO NOT MODIFY this file unless, unless
+# the change can meant to be supplied to
+# others.
+#
+# For user specific customization, use home.user.nix
+{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
 let
+  if-exists = f: builtins.pathExists f;
+  existing-imports = imports: builtins.filter if-exists imports;
   user = import ./user.nix;
 in
 {
+  imports = existing-imports [
+    ./home.user.nix
+  ];
+
   home.username = user.name;
   home.homeDirectory = user.homeDir;
   home.stateVersion = "22.11"; import ./user.nix;
 in
 {
```

Above changes, allow us to import `home.user.nix`, if exists, otherwise, we are still going
to make use home.nix.

Also note that we are not making any update on `home.packages`, yet. This is because
It is a lot easier to manage list of packages only through `home.user.nix`, instead of
doing it both in  `home.nix` and `home.user.nix`.

But we don't want to just hard code set of common packages in `home.user.nix` file.

For that, we are going to create `provided-pkgs.nix` file

```nix
# This file should be maintained by a team X
# DO NOT MODIFY directly
# for local configurations use home.user.nix
{ pkgs, lib, ... }:
let
  removeAll = excludes: all: lib.lists.fold (acc: item: lib.lists.remove item acc) all excludes;
  provided-pkgs = with pkgs; [
    # Provide org-wide packages here
    bashInteractive
    jq
    curl
    git 
    nodejs-18_x
  ];
  with-user-pkgs = inst:
    let
      excludes = inst.excludes;
      includes = inst.includes;
      without-excludes = removeAll excludes provided-pkgs;
    in
    lib.lists.unique (provided-pkgs ++ includes);
in
{
  inherit provided-pkgs;
  inherit with-user-pkgs;
}
```

Then, time to add `home.user.nix`

```nix
{ pkgs, lib, ... }:
let
  provided-pkgs-args = { inherit pkgs; inherit lib; };
  provided-pkgs = import ./provided-pkgs.nix provided-pkgs-args;
in
{
  home.packages = with pkgs;
    provided-pkgs.with-user-pkgs {
      excludes = [ ];
      includes = [
        gh
        exa
        lazygit
        bat
        zellij
        unstable.neovim
        python311
        python311Packages.pip
      ];
    };

  programs.starship = {
    enable = true;
  };
}
```

The `provided-pkgs.nix` provides very neat function for users to manage home-manager
packages. For example, let's say, I would like to use nodejs 14.x over 18.x. A user
can now update home.user.nix file into

```nix
home.packages = with pkgs; 
  provided-pkgs.with-user-pkgs {
    excludes = [
        # opt out the packages from provided-pkgs
        nodejs-18_x
    ];
    includes = [
        nodejs-14_x
    ];
  }
```

Users can now customize further without needing to intricacy of home-manager's detail.
While we would like to commit `provided-pkgs.nix`, we do not want to check in `home.user.nix`
into our dotfiles, as it would be different per each user. So instead of checking
in `home.user.nix`, we are going to create a file called `home.user.nix.tpl`, so that
users can easily get started by copying content of `home.user.nix.tpl` as home.user.nix.

## shell configurations

Similar to changes of home-manager configurations, we are going to separate create hierarchy
of shell configurations.

In the previous post, we've created hierarchy for each shell that we are going to support in
following manner.

```
.
├── .bashrc                    # controlled by nix
├── .zshrc                     # controlled by nix
├── .config 
│  ├── bash
│  │  └── .bashrc              # custom bash config
│  ├── zsh
│  │  └── .zshrc               # custom zsh config
│  ├── fish
│  │  ├── config.fish          # controlled by nix
|  │  └── config.base.fish     # custom fish config
```

We would like to change them into followings:

```
.
├── .bashrc                    # controlled by nix
├── .zshrc                     # controlled by nix
├── .config 
│  ├── bash
│  │  ├── .bashrc              # common bash config
│  │  ├── user.bash            # user bash config
│  │  └── secret.bash          # place for API tokens, secrets... etc
│  ├── zsh
│  │  ├── .zshrc               # common zsh config
│  │  ├── user.zsh             # user zsh config
│  │  └── secret.zsh           # place for API tokens, secrets... etc
│  ├── fish
│  │  ├── config.fish          # controlled by nix
│  │  ├── config.base.fish     # common fish config
│  │  ├── config.user.fish     # user fish config
|  │  └── config.secret.fish   #  place for API tokens, secrets... etc
```

Just like what we did in our home.nix file, we just need to update each custom config files to
add conditional file import.

For this to work, we are going to a few lines into .bashrc, .zshrc, and config.base.fish as following:

.bashrc

```sh
# DO NOT MODIFY this file unless, the change is required
# for all memebers.
#
# This file provide set of common bash configurations
# that are useful for all of us.

# set up PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.config/bin

if [ -f $HOME/.config/bash/user.bash ]; then
	source $HOME/.config/bash/user.bash
fi

if [ -f $HOME/.config/bash/secret.bash ]; then
	source $HOME/.config/bash/secret.bash
fi
```

.zshrc

```sh
# DO NOT MODIFY this file unless, the change is required
# for all memebers.
#
# This file provide set of common zsh configurations
# that are useful for all of us.

# region: setup
# TODO:: add more configs
# endregion 

if [ -f $HOME/.config/zsh/user.zsh ]; then
  source $HOME/.config/zsh/user.zsh
fi

if [ -f $HOME/.config/zsh/secret.zsh ]; then
  source $HOME/.config/zsh/secret.zsh
fi
```

config.base.fish

```fish
# DO NOT MODIFY this file unless, the change is required
# for all memebers.
#
# This file provide set of common fish configurations
# that are useful for all of us.

# region: setup
# TODO:: add more configs
# endregion 

if test -f $HOME/.config/fish/config.user.fish
  source $HOME/.config/fish/config.user.fish
end

if test -f $HOME/.config/fish/config.secret.fish
  source $HOME/.config/fish/config.secret.fish
end
```

Now, we are ready test these new structure. For a demonstration, let's add a custom zsh configuration

```sh
cat <<EOF > ~/.config/zsh/user.zsh
echo "My Custom config"
EOF

zsh # loading a new zsh session
```

And you should see that our zsh session prints out 

```
My Custom config
```

## Conclusion

By supplying a further hierarchy of configurations, we have successfully created a nix set up that can
be used to supply common configurations for everyone in an organization, while providing an ability for
each users to customize their own environment. 

`provided-pkgs.nix` file is used to provide common packages that we would like to distribute to everyone
in a team, while `home.user.nix` can be used to provide further customization for an end user.

Similarly, common shell configurations can be managed by `~/.config/bash/.bashrc`, `~/.config/zsh/.zshrc`, and 
`~/.config/fish/config.base.fish`, while `~/.config/bash/user.bash`, `~/.config/zsh/user.zsh`, and 
`~/.config/fish/config.user.fish` provide place for further customization for an end user, without needing to
set up above shell environment using nix.
