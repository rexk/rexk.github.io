    With help of nix, flake, home-manager and nix-direnv. We can have almost reproducible dev
    environments per each directory. This allows us to easily switch between slightly different
    dev environment configurations without needing docker or virtual machine.

## Goal

We've set up nix and home-manager with flake from our the previous post. In this post,
we are going to further customize our dotfiles, and then integrate nix-direnv using
home-manager so that we can start having reproducible dev environment per directory.

For those of you that are impatient, a full snippets can be found at

* https://github.com/rexk/home-manager-direnv-example/tree/nodejs-example
* https://github.com/rexk/dotfiles/tree/nix-flake-install-stage-02

## Before getting started

Before getting started, let's add a convenient shell script so that we can interact with our
dotfiles bare repo easier.

Add following script at: `~/.config/bin/dit`

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# ------------------------------------------------
# dit - short hand for git for dotfiles
# ------------------------------------------------
# As we control dotfiles as git's bare repo, 
# it is cumbersome to type out whole work-tree
# git command to interact with our dotfiles folder
#
# dit command gives us easy access to control out dotilfes
# without deviating too much from our `git` command flow


CONFIG_DIR=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:=$HOME/.config}
git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles.git --work-tree=$CONFIG_DIR "$@"
```

## direnv and nix-direnv

`direnv` let me control directory level dev environment setup with `.envrc` file.
But I would like to use this with nix's flake. Luckily there is a community project
laready exists with nix and direnv integration, nix-direnv.

With home-manager, it is really simple to integrate nix-direnv with my current system.

```diff
@@ -5,5 +5,7 @@ in
   home.username = user.name;
   home.homeDirectory = user.homeDir;
   home.stateVersion = "22.11";
+
+  programs.direnv.enable = true;
 }
 ```

After the file is updated, now we need to run our `hms` (home-manager switch) command.

We can verify our installation by running `direnv` from the terminal.

```sh
direnv --version
2.32.1
```

Now that, we have dirnev installed, it is time for us to test out our direnv setup.

I would like to set up a nodejs project using express NodeJs version with 18.x LTS.

1. Create a project directory
2. Add flake.nix
3. Update flake.nix to pull nodejs 18.x
4. Add .envrc
5. Execute `direnv allow`

```sh
mkdir -p nodejs-18-example
cd nodejs-18-example
```

Then, we are going to add following flake.nix at the root of nodejs-18-example

```nix
{
  description = "nodejs-18-example-flake";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-22.11";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }:
    let
      utils = flake-utils;
    in
    utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in
      {
        formatter = pkgs.nixpkgs-fmt;

        devShell = pkgs.mkShell {
          nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
            nodejs-18_x
          ];
        };
      }
    );
}
```

Before we proceed further, flake.nix file must be commited into git.

```sh
git add flake.nix
git commit -am "Add flake.nix"
```

Once flake.nix file is committed, we are going to add `.envrc` file with the following content:

```sh
use flake
```

Once both files are successfully added, we are going to see following error messages:

```sh
direnv: error /home/rexk/rexk-workspace/home-manager-direnv-example/nodejs-18-express/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
```

Run `direnv allow` so that direnv can do its job.

Now, nix and direnv will do its magic, and download nodejs for us.

```sh
node --version
v18.14.1
```

As long as flake.lock file and flake.nix file does not change, nodejs-18-express will alawys
use same nodejs versions no matter who enter this project. Neat
